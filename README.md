3. [Drone Technology](Documentation/drone-technology/README.md)

## 💡 Why This Project?

The impetus behind Drone Demineur is grounded in several alarming facts and humanitarian concerns:

- **Extensive Minefields**: Current estimates suggest it could take up to 150 years to completely demine areas like Ukraine, reflecting a global challenge.
- **Diversity of Mines**: There are over 350 types of mines worldwide, making detection and neutralization a complex task.
- **Affordable & Safe Solutions**: Traditional demining methods are expensive and perilous. Drone Demineur aims to offer a cost-effective and safe alternative to locate mines without endangering human lives.
- **Civilian Casualties & Child Safety**: Landmines continue to kill and injure civilians long after conflicts end. Many of these victims are children who mistake unexploded ordnance and cluster bombs for toys. Our project strives to mitigate these tragedies by efficiently identifying and marking minefields, thereby preventing such accidents.

By addressing these challenges, Drone Demineur aspires to contribute significantly to global peace and safety, turning once-dangerous lands back into safe, usable spaces for communities worldwide.
